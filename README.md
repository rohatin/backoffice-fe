# Setup

Mainly forked from external source since setting everything up from scratch was painful enough for the backend.
I really think this project would be suited by next way better than just react but I wanted to follow the given guideline.
Where I think nextjs would really shine and outperform react is at auth handling when paired with auth.js and specific for my implementation at the different environment diferentiated by an API key.
